# ellipsoid-sphere-fitting-sensor-calibration-stm32
This repository contains the ellipsoid sphere fitting calibration method based on C and STM32. This method originally is developed by STMicroelectronics co. based on MATLAB which you can find in the following link https://tinyurl.com/jfs3v29s. 
This library is tested on sampled data from Lis3mdl magnetometer on STM32F103RBTx.
Default project files and other settings related to peripheralls such as gpio, ... are generated by STM32CubeMx based on SW4STM32 Toolchain.
